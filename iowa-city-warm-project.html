          I started the Iowa City Warm Project because I saw a real need in my community.
          1 in 4 people in Iowa City do not have their needs met in the winter. I myself, noticed how many people
          were experiencing homelessness or struggling to get basic essentials. I wanted to help in a simple,
          direct way: collect coats, jackets, and winter items and deliver them to the people who need them.
          So far, I’ve organized collected over 100 items and distributed clothing directly to community members and through
          local connections. My goal is to keep this local, respectful, and focused on real help when temperatures drop.
          Let's keep Iowa City warm. :)         </p>
