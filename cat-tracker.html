      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Indoor Cat Tracker is a scalable IoT system designed to help pet owners monitor their cat’s location
        inside their home. Using BLE beacons, a wearable receiver, and a cloud-hosted web interface, the
        system estimates position in real time and visualizes movement patterns across sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal was to combine <strong>hardware sensing</strong>, <strong>data ingestion</strong>, and
        <strong>web-based analytics</strong> into a single usable system.

      <h2>System Architecture (Components)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BLE Beacons + Receiver (ESP-32):</strong> Beacons broadcast signals; receiver estimates distance using RSSI.</li>
        <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Bridge:</strong> Aggregates BLE readings and forwards batched data over Wi-Fi.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Backend:</strong> Stores session and position data; serves the web UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Dashboard:</strong> Displays live location data, session heatmaps, and playback controls.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data & Analytics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Location points recorded every <strong>1–2 seconds</strong></li>
        <li>Session-based tracking (start / stop / review past sessions)</li>
        <li>Heatmap visualization of frequently visited locations</li>
        <li>Historical sessions stored per user for behavior analysis</li>
        <li>Boundary-based alerts notify users when the cat leaves the beacon range</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Embedded / Hardware:</strong> ESP-32 (BLE 5.3), Arduino C</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Raspberry Pi, Node.js (BLE ingestion + HTTP forwarding)</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python, Flask, SQLite</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, JavaScript (dynamic heatmaps & session playback)</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> AWS EC2</li>
        <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> BLE + Wi-Fi</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Built the initial web server and key API endpoints to support data flow and session handling</li>
        <li>Developed the frontend interface for live tracking and session playback</li>
        <li>Focused on usability: interactive UI that works in any browser without client installs</li>
        <li>Helped translate session data into interpretable heatmaps and timeline playback</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Challenges & Tradeoffs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>BLE RSSI introduces noise and limits positional accuracy</li>
        <li>Used trilateration after angle-of-arrival features weren’t available in ESP-32 core libraries</li>
        <li>Improved results by tuning transmission power and increasing beacon count</li>
        <li>Chose SQLite for simplicity given low write frequency and lightweight storage needs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User authentication via <code>flask_login</code></li>
        <li>Minimized data collection (timestamps and position only)</li>
        <li>Server-side storage and processing to reduce exposure</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <p>
        Indoor Cat Tracker demonstrated a full end-to-end IoT pipeline:
        <strong>sensors → ingestion → cloud storage → analytics → visualization</strong>.
        The system was technically feasible and extensible, with clear next steps around accuracy and UX polish.
