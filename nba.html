            Are you quietly confident your team will bounce back—or is it a sneak preview
            of how the game will end?

        <h2>Claim</h2>
        <p>
          Expanding on Berger &amp; Pope’s halftime findings, I argue that “losing” by itself only
          minimally shifts a team’s raw chance of winning, but it matters a lot more once you layer
          in context: team strength, roster age, and rest.
        </p>

      <section class="proj-section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Berger &amp; Pope (“Can Losing Lead to Winning?”) suggest teams slightly behind at halftime
            may win more often due to motivation/effort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Klein Teeselink et al. revisit the idea across sports with larger datasets and find the effect
            small/inconsistent and often not statistically reliable with tighter models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Andrew Gelman argues the original effect may be overstated and highlights how modeling choices
            can make tiny effects look big.

        <h2>Finding 1: Raw halftime win curve looks normal</h2>
        <p>
          My version of the halftime curve for the full 2024–25 season slopes upward smoothly:
          big halftime leads matter a lot. Near zero, being down a couple points nudges odds, but doesn’t
          flip the game by itself.

        <h2>Finding 2: Strength changes what “down at half” means</h2>
        <p>
          Conditioning on games where the home team is losing at halftime, comeback rates depend heavily on
          team strength:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strong:</strong> ~39% comeback rate</li>
          <li><strong>Middle:</strong> ~29%</li>
          <li><strong>Weak:</strong> ~13%</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Finding 3: Older rosters are slightly better at comebacks</h2>
        <p>
          Again only for home teams trailing at halftime:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Old:</strong> ~33%</li>
          <li><strong>Prime:</strong> ~30%</li>
          <li><strong>Young:</strong> ~24%</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="proj-section">
        <h2>Finding 4: Rest matters a lot</h2>
        <p>
          Among home teams trailing at halftime:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0–1 days rest:</strong> ~18%</li>
          <li><strong>2–3 days rest:</strong> ~31%</li>
          <li><strong>4+ days rest:</strong> ~26% (possible rust or weird schedule spots)</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="proj-section">
        <h2>Finding 5: Combining strength + age + rest shows the “rubber band” pattern</h2>
        <p>
          When combining all three factors (still only looking at teams losing at halftime), the difference is huge.
          Strong teams on normal rest come back roughly ~41–47% across age groups.
          Weak, young teams on normal rest flip the deficit only around ~6% of the time.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          So, does losing lead to winning? Not in a universal way.
          On average, losing at halftime only modestly affects raw win probability and generally disadvantages you.
          
          But once you condition on context—who is trailing, how strong they are, how old they are, and how rested they are,
          the data is patterned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being down at half is close to a death sentence for weak, young, tired teams.
          For strong, rested teams, it’s closer to a challenge they’re likely to solve.
